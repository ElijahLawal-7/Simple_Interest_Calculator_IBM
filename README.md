##IBM - Introduction to Web Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Simple Interest Calculator

Everyone Can Get Rich is a non governmental charity organization. This NGO works to improve the financial literacy of the common people. They have hired a developer to create an online application. This app titled Simple Interest Calculator, will compute the interest one can earn given the amount you wish to save, the number of years you can keep it invested and the interest rate the bank would pay you.

The NGO is very particular about the way the app looks including the colors and the alignment of the form elements. The NGO wants the app to look exactly like this. <br>
